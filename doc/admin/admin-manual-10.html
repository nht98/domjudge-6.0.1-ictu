<P>This section contains instructions specifically for those wishing
to modify the DOMjudge source. If you have any questions about
developing DOMjudge, or if you want to share your changes that
may be useful to others, please don't hesitate to contact us
through 
<A HREF="https://www.domjudge.org/mailman/listinfo/domjudge-devel">our development mailing list</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc10.1">Bootstrapping from Git repository sources</A>
</H2>


<P>The installation steps in this document assume that you are using a
downloaded tarball from the DOMjudge website. If you want to install
from Git repository sources, because you want to use the bleeding edge
code or consider to send a patch to the developers, the
configure/build system first has to be bootstrapped.</P>
<P>This requires
additional software to be installed:
<UL>
<LI> The GNU autoconf/automake toolset
</LI>
<LI> Composer - PHP Package Manager.
</LI>
<LI> Linuxdoc and groff to build the admin and judge
documentation from SGML sources and a LaTeX installation to
generate the PDF admin, judge and default team manual.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>On Debian(-based) systems, the following apt command should
install the additionally required packages (next to the
<A HREF="admin-manual-3.html#install_config:package-install">standard set of packages</A>):
<HR>
<PRE>
sudo apt install autoconf automake git composer
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Composer is packaged since Debian Stretch and Ubuntu Xenial.
Alternatively, it can be installed by following the documentation
located 
<A HREF="https://getcomposer.org/download">here</A>.</P>
<P>When this software is present, bootstrapping can be done by running
<CODE>make dist</CODE>, which creates the <CODE>configure</CODE> script,
downloads and installs the PHP dependencies via composer and
generates documentation from SGML/LaTeX sources.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc10.2">Maintainer mode installation</A>
</H2>


<P>Besides the two modes of installation described in section
<A HREF="admin-manual-3.html#install_config:installsystem">Installation system</A>,
DOMjudge provides a special maintainer mode installation.
This method does an in-place installation within the source
tree. This allows one to immediately see effects when modifying
code.</P>
<P>This method requires some special steps which can most easily
be run via makefile rules as follows:
<HR>
<PRE>
sudo apt install acl
make maintainer-conf [CONFIGURE_FLAGS=&lt;extra options for ./configure&gt;]
make maintainer-install
</PRE>
<HR>

Note that these targets have to be executed <EM>separately</EM> and
they replace the steps described in the section
<A HREF="admin-manual-3.html#install_config:installsystem">Installation system</A>;
also no <CODE>--prefix</CODE> flag or other directories have to be
specified to <CODE>configure</CODE>. In this case the binaries
(e.g. <CODE>judgedaemon</CODE> and <CODE>dj_setup_database</CODE>) can be
found in their respective source directories, and are also symlinked
in <CODE>bin</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc10.3">Makefile structure</A>
</H2>


<P>The Makefiles in the source tree use a recursion mechanism to run make
targets within the relevant subdirectories. The recursion is handled
by the <CODE>REC_TARGETS</CODE> and <CODE>SUBDIRS</CODE> variables and the
recursion step is executed in <CODE>Makefile.global</CODE>. Any target
added to the <CODE>REC_TARGETS</CODE> list will be recursively called in
all directories in <CODE>SUBDIRS</CODE>. Moreover, a local variant of the
target with <CODE>-l</CODE> appended is called after recursing into the
subdirectories, so recursion is depth-first.</P>
<P>The targets <CODE>dist, clean, distclean, maintainer-clean</CODE> are
recursive by default, which means that these call their local
<CODE>-l</CODE> variants in all directories containing a Makefile. This
allows for true depth-first traversal, which is necessary to correctly
run the <CODE>*clean</CODE> targets: otherwise e.g. <CODE>paths.mk</CODE> will
be deleted before subdirectory <CODE>*clean</CODE> targets are called that
depend on information in it.</P>
