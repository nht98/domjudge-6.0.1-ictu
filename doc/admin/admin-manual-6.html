<H2><A NAME="webinterface"></A> <A NAME="s6">6.</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc6">Web interface</A></H2>


<P>The web interface is the main point of interaction with the system.
Here you can view submissions coming in, control judging,
view the standings and edit data.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc6.1">Jury and Administrator view</A>
</H2>


<P>The jury interface has two possible views: one for jury members,
and one for DOMjudge administrators. The second view is the same as
the jury view, but with more features added, and can be enabled by
giving a user the 'admin' role (instead of or next to the 'jury' role).</P>
<P>This separation is handy as a matter of security (jury members cannot
(accidentally) modify things that shouldn't be) and clarity (jury members
are not confused / distracted by options they don't need).</P>
<P>Options offered to administrators only:
<UL>
<LI>Adding and editing any contest data</LI>
<LI>Managing team passwords</LI>
<LI>The config checker</LI>
<LI>Refreshing the scoreboard &amp; hostname caches</LI>
<LI>Rejudge 'correct' submissions</LI>
<LI>Restart 'pending' judgings</LI>
</UL>

Furthermore, some quick link menu items might differ according to
usefulness for jury or admins.</P>
<P><EM>A note on rejudging:</EM> it is policy within the DOMjudge system
that a correct solution cannot be reverted to incorrect. Therefore,
administrator rights are required to rejudge correct or pending
(hence, possibly correct) submissions. For some more details on
rejudging, see the jury manual.</P>


<H2><A NAME="scoreboard"></A> <A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc6.2">The scoreboard </A>
</H2>


<P>The scoreboard is the canonical overview for anyone interested in the
contest, be it jury, teams or the general public. It deserves to get a
section of its own.</P>

<H3><A NAME="scoreboard:colours"></A> Colours and sorting </H3>


<P>Each problem can be associated with a specific colour, e.g. the colour
of the corresponding balloon that is handed out. DOMjudge can display
this colour on the scoreboard, if you fill in the `color' attribute in
the `problem' table; set it to a 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1#color-units">valid CSS colour value</A> (e.g. `green'
or `#ff0000', although a name is preferred for displaying colour
names).</P>
<P>It's possible to have different categories of teams participating,
this is controlled through the `team_category' table. Each category
has its own background colour in the scoreboard. This colour can be
set with the `color' attribute to a valid CSS colour value.</P>
<P>If you wish, you can also define a sortorder in the category table.
This is the first field that the scoreboard is sorted on. If you want
regular teams to be sorted first, but after them you want to sort both
spectator- and business teams equally, you define `0' for the regular
category and `1' for the other categories. To completely remove a
category from the public (but not the jury) scoreboard, the category
visible flag can be set to `0'.</P>


<H3>Starting and ending</H3>


<P>A contest can be selected for viewing after its activation time, but
the scoreboard will only become visible to public and teams once the
contest starts. Thus no data such as problems and teams is revealed
before then.</P>
<P>When the contest ends, the scores will remain displayed until the
deactivation time passes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="scoreboard:freeze"></A> Freezing and defrosting </H3>


<P>DOMjudge has the option to `freeze' the public- and team scoreboards
at some point during the contest. This means that scores are no longer
updated and remain to be displayed as they were at the time of the
freeze. This is often done to keep the last hour interesting for all.
The scoreboard freeze time can be set with the `freezetime'
attribute in the contest table.</P>
<P>The scoreboard freezing works by looking at the time a submission is
made. Therefore it's possible that submissions from (just) before the
freezetime but judged after it can still cause updates to the public
scoreboard. A rejudging during the freeze may also cause such updates.</P>
<P>If you do not set any freeze time, this option does nothing. If you
set it, the public and team scoreboards will not be updated anymore
once this time has arrived. The jury will however still see the actual
scoreboard.</P>
<P>Once the contest is over, the scores are not directly `unfrozen'.
This is done to keep them secret until e.g. the prize ceremony. You
can release the final scores to team and public interfaces when the
time is right. You can do this either by setting a predefined
`unfreezetime' in the contest table, or you push the `unfreeze
now' button in the jury web interface, under contests.</P>

<H3>Clickability</H3>


<P>Almost every cell is clickable in the jury interface and gives
detailed information relevant to that cell. This is (of course) not
available in the team and public scoreboards, except that in the team
and public interface the team name cell links to a page with some more
information and optionally a team picture, and the problem header
cells link to the problem text, if available.</P>

<H3>Caching</H3>


<P>The scoreboard is not recalculated on every page load, but rather
cached in the database. It should be safe for repeated reloads from
many clients. In exceptional situations (should never occur in normal
operation, e.g. a bug in DOMjudge), the cache may become inaccurate.
The jury administrator interface contains an option to recalculate a
fresh version of the entire scoreboard. You should use this option
only when actually necessary, since it puts quite a load on the
database.</P>

<H3>Exporting to an external website</H3>


<P>In many cases you might want to create a copy of the scoreboard for
external viewing from the internet. Just for that, the public interface
can be called with the url parameter <CODE>?static=1</CODE>. It produces
a version of the scoreboard with refresh meta-tags, login facilities
and links to team pages removed. This can for example be requested
every minute via <CODE>curl</CODE> and the output be placed as static
content on a publicly reachable webserver.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc6.3">Balloons</A>
</H2>


<P>In many contests balloons are handed out to teams that solve a
particular problem. DOMjudge can help in this process: both a web
interface and a notification daemon are available to notify that a new
balloon needs to be handed out. Note that only one should be used at a
time.</P>
<P>The web based tool is reachable from the main page in the jury
interface, where each balloon has to be checked off by the person
handing it out.</P>
<P>For the daemon, set the <CODE>BALLOON_CMD</CODE> in
<CODE>etc/domserver-config.php</CODE> to define how notifications
are sent. Examples are to mail to a specific mailbox or to send
prints to a printer. When configured, start <CODE>bin/balloons</CODE>
and notification will start.</P>
<P>Notifications will stop as soon as the scoreboard is frozen.
Enable the <CODE>show_balloons_postfreeze</CODE> configuration option to
keep issuing balloon notifications after the freeze.</P>
