<P>After installation is successful, you want to run your contest!
Configuring DOMjudge to run a contest (or a number of them, in
sequence) involves the following steps:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Configure the contest data;</LI>
<LI> Set up authentication for teams;</LI>
<LI> Supply in- and output testdata;</LI>
<LI> Check that everything works.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="contestsetup:database"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc4.1">Configure the contest data </A>
</H2>


<P>DOMjudge stores and retrieves most of its data from the MySQL
database. Some information must be filled in beforehand, other tables
will be populated by DOMjudge.</P>
<P>You can use the jury web interface to add, edit and delete most types
of data described below. It's advised to keep a version of phpMyAdmin
handy in case of emergencies, or for general database operations like
import and export.</P>
<P>This section describes the meaning of each table and what you need to
put into it. Tables marked with an `x' are the ones you have to
configure with contest data before running a contest (via the jury web
interface or e.g. with phpMyAdmin), the other tables are used
automatically by the software:

</P>
<P>Now follows a longer description (including fields) per table that has
to be filled manually. As a general remark: almost all tables have an
identifier field. Most of these are numeric and automatically
increasing; these do not need to be specified. The tables
<CODE>executable</CODE> and <CODE>language</CODE> have text strings as identifier
fields. These need to be manually specified and only alpha-numeric, dash and
underscore characters are valid, i.e. <CODE>a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>configuration</B><DD>
<P>This table contains configuration settings.
These entries are simply stored as <CODE>name, value</CODE> pairs, where
the values are JSON encoded, <CODE>type</CODE> contains the allowed data
type, and <CODE>description</CODE> documents the configuration setting.</P>

<DT><B>contest</B><DD>
<P>The contests that the software will run. E.g. a test session and the
live contest.</P>
<P><CODE>cid</CODE> is the reference ID and <CODE>contestname</CODE> is a
descriptive name used in the interface, while <CODE>shortname</CODE> is
the publicly visible identifier.</P>
<P><CODE>activatetime</CODE>, <CODE>starttime</CODE> and <CODE>endtime</CODE>
are required fields and specify when this contest is active and
open for submissions. Optional <CODE>freezetime</CODE> and
<CODE>unfreezetime</CODE> control scoreboard freezing and
<CODE>deactivatetime</CODE> when the contest is not visible anymore.
For a detailed treating of these, see section 
<A HREF="#contestsetup:milestones">Contest milestones</A>.
All contest times can be specified relative to <CODE>starttime</CODE>,
except of course <CODE>starttime</CODE> itself. The input given in the
jury interface (either relative or absolute) is stored in the
<CODE>*time_string</CODE> fields, while a calculated absolute version is
stored in the fields without the <CODE>_string</CODE> suffix.</P>
<P>The <CODE>public</CODE> field can be used to limit which contests are
displayed as public scoreboards (as opposed to privately to a selected
set of teams), while <CODE>enabled</CODE> can be used to (temporarily)
disable a contest altogether.</P>

<DT><B>contestproblem</B><DD>
<P>This table couples problems to contests: <CODE>cid</CODE> and
<CODE>probid</CODE> describe the pairing.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it stores problem data that is specific for the included
contest: <CODE>shortname</CODE> is a contest-unique identifier string for
the problem, <CODE>points</CODE> defaults to 1 and can be set to assign
non-even scoring; <CODE>allow_submit</CODE> determines whether teams can submit
solutions for this problem. Non-submittable problems are also not
displayed on the scoreboard. This can be used to define spare
problems, which can then be added to the contest quickly;
<CODE>allow_judge</CODE> determines whether judgehosts will judge
submissions for this problem. See also the explanation for language.</P>
<P>The <CODE>color</CODE> tag can be filled with a CSS colour specification
to associate with this problem; see also section 
<A HREF="admin-manual-6.html#scoreboard:colours">Scoreboard: colours</A>.</P>

<DT><B>contestteam</B><DD>
<P>This table couples teams to contests. Teams can only submit solutions to
problems in contests that are public or which they are part of.</P>

<DT><B>executable</B><DD>
<P>This table stores zip-bundles of executable scripts that can be used
as compile, run, and compare scripts.</P>

<DT><B>judgehost_restriction</B><DD>
<P>This table encodes restriction sets for selecting which submissions
are sent to a judgehost. The restrictions are JSON encoded in
the <CODE>restrictions</CODE> column, and can be set in the admin web
interface to restrict on specific contests, problems, languages, and
to never rejudge on the same judgehost. A restriction set can be
assigned to judgehost(s) on the edit page of the judgehosts overview.</P>

<DT><B>language</B><DD>
<P>Programming languages in which to accept and judge submissions.
<CODE>langid</CODE> is a string of maximum length 8, which references the
language.
<CODE>name</CODE> is the displayed name of the language;
<CODE>extensions</CODE> is a JSON encoded list of recognized filename extensions;
<CODE>allow_submit</CODE> determines whether teams can submit
using this language; <CODE>allow_judge</CODE> determines whether
judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. This can for
example be set to <EM>no</EM> to temporarily hold judging when a problem occurs
with the judging of a specific language; after resolution of the
problem this can be set to <EM>yes</EM> again.</P>
<P><CODE>time_factor</CODE> is the relative factor by which the timelimit is
multiplied for solutions in this language; <CODE>compile_script</CODE>
refers to a compile executable script that is used for this language.</P>

<DT><B>problem</B><DD>
<P>This table contains the problem definitions. <CODE>probid</CODE> is the
reference ID, <CODE>cid</CODE> is the contest ID this problem is (only)
defined for: a problem cannot be used in multiple contests.
<CODE>name</CODE> is the full name (description) of the problem.</P>
<P><CODE>allow_submit</CODE> determines whether teams can submit
solutions for this problem. Non-submittable problems are also not
displayed on the scoreboard. This can be used to define spare
problems, which can then be added to the contest quickly;
<CODE>allow_judge</CODE> determines whether judgehosts will judge
submissions for this problem. See also the explanation for language.</P>
<P><CODE>timelimit</CODE> is the timelimit in seconds
within which solutions for this problem have to run (taking into
account <CODE>time_factor</CODE> per language). See also
<A HREF="admin-manual-8.html#problems:timelimits">enforcement of time limits</A> for
more details.</P>
<P><CODE>memlimit</CODE> is the memory limit in kB allotted for this problem.
If empty then the global configuration setting <CODE>memory_limit</CODE>
is used. Equivalently for <CODE>outputlimit</CODE>.</P>
<P><CODE>special_run</CODE> if not empty defines a custom run program
<CODE>run_&lt;special_run&gt;</CODE> to run compiled submissions for
this problem and <CODE>special_compare</CODE> if not empty defines a
custom compare program <CODE>compare_&lt;special_compare&gt;</CODE> to
compare output for this problem.</P>
<P>The <CODE>color</CODE> tag can be filled with a CSS colour specification
to associate with this problem; see also section 
<A HREF="admin-manual-6.html#scoreboard:colours">Scoreboard: colours</A>.</P>
<P>In <CODE>problemtext</CODE> a PDF, HTML or plain text document can be
placed which allows team, public and jury to download the problem
statement. Note that no additional filtering takes place, so HTML
(and PDF to some extent) should be from a trusted source to prevent
cross site scripting or other attacks. The file type is stored in
<CODE>problemtext_type</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B>team</B><DD>
<P>Table of teams: <CODE>teamid</CODE> is (internal) ID of the team,
while <CODE>externalid</CODE> can be used to store an ID for im/exporting
to other systems.
<CODE>name</CODE> the displayed name of the team, <CODE>categoryid</CODE> is
the ID of the category the team is in; <CODE>affilid</CODE> is the
affiliation ID of the team.</P>
<P>When <CODE>enabled</CODE> is set to 0, the team immediately disappears from
the scoreboards and cannot use the team web interface anymore, even
when already logged in. One use case could be to disqualify a team on
the spot.</P>
<P><CODE>members</CODE> are the names of the team members, separated by
newlines and <CODE>room</CODE> is the location or room of the team, both for
display only; <CODE>comments</CODE> can be filled with arbitrary useful
information and is only visible to the jury.
The timestamp <CODE>teampage_first_visited</CODE> and the <CODE>hostname</CODE>
field indicate when/whether/from where a team visited its team web interface.</P>
<P>The <CODE>penalty</CODE> field can be used to give this team a (positive
or negative) number of penalty minutes to correct for exceptional
circumstances.</P>

<DT><B>team_affiliation</B><DD>
<P><CODE>affilid</CODE> is the reference ID and <CODE>name</CODE> the name of the
institution. <CODE>country</CODE> should be the 3 character
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3#Officially_assigned_code_elements">ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 abbreviation</A>
of the country and <CODE>comments</CODE> is a free form field
that is displayed in the jury interface.</P>
<P>A country flag can be displayed on the scoreboard. For this to work,
the <CODE>country</CODE> field must match a (flag) picture in
<CODE>webapp/web/images/countries/&lt;country&gt;.png</CODE>. All
country flags are present there, named with their 3-character ISO
codes. See also <CODE>webapp/web/images/countries/README</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B>team_category</B><DD>
<P><CODE>categoryid</CODE> is the reference ID and <CODE>name</CODE> is a string:
the name of the category. <CODE>sortorder</CODE> is the order at which
this group must be sorted in the scoreboard, where a higher number
sorts lower and equal sort depending on score.</P>
<P>The <CODE>color</CODE> is again a CSS colour specification used to
discern different categories easily. See also section 
<A HREF="admin-manual-6.html#scoreboard:colours">Scoreboard: colours</A>.</P>
<P>The <CODE>visible</CODE> flag determines whether teams in this category
are displayed on the public/team scoreboard. This feature can be used
to remove teams from the public scoreboard by assigning them to a
separate, invisible category.</P>

<DT><B>testcase</B><DD>
<P>The testcase table contains testdata for each problem;
<CODE>testcaseid</CODE> is a unique identifier, <CODE>input</CODE> and
<CODE>output</CODE> contain the testcase input/output and <CODE>image</CODE>
an optional graphical representation of the testcase for the jury.
The fields <CODE>md5sum_input</CODE>, <CODE>md5sum_output</CODE>,
and <CODE>md5sum_image</CODE> contain their respective md5
hashes to check for up-to-date-ness of cached versions by the
judgehosts and <CODE>image_thumb</CODE> and <CODE>image_type</CODE> a
thumbnail version and mimetype string for the image.
The field <CODE>probid</CODE> is the corresponding problem and
<CODE>rank</CODE> determines the order of the testcases for one problem.
<CODE>description</CODE> is an optional description for this testcase. See
also 
<A HREF="#contestsetup:testdata">providing testdata</A>.</P>

<DT><B>user</B><DD>
<P>This table has the users that the system knows about with their
login credentials. Each user may have one or more roles, like
being part of a team, being a jury member or administrator.
There are also functional accounts, like for judgedaemons.</P>

</DL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="contestsetup:milestones"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc4.2">Contest milestones</A>
</H2>


<P>The <CODE>contest</CODE> table specifies timestamps for each contest
that mark specific milestones in the course of the contest.</P>
<P>The triplet <EM>activatetime</EM>, <EM>starttime</EM> and <EM>endtime</EM>
define when the contest runs and are required fields (activatetime and
starttime may be equal).</P>
<P>activatetime is the moment when a contest first becomes
visible to the public and teams . Nothing can be submitted yet and the
problem set is not revealed. Clarifications can be viewed and sent.</P>
<P>At starttime, the scoreboard is displayed and submissions are accepted.
At endtime the contest stops. New incoming submissions will still be
processed and judged, but the result will not be shown anymore to teams;
they instead receive the verdict`too-late'. Unjudged submissions received
before endtime will still be judged normally.</P>
<P><EM>freezetime</EM> and <EM>unfreezetime</EM> control scoreboard
freezing. freezetime is the time after which the public and team
scoreboard are not updated anymore (frozen). This is meant to make the
last stages of the contest more thrilling, because no-one knows who has
won. Leaving them empty disables this feature. When using this feature,
unfreezetime can be set to automatically `unfreeze' the scoreboard at
that time. For a more elaborate description, see also section 
<A HREF="admin-manual-6.html#scoreboard:freeze">Scoreboard: freezing and defrosting</A>.</P>
<P>The scoreboard, results and clarifications will remain to be displayed
to team and public after a contest, until the <EM>deactivatetime</EM>.</P>
<P>All events happen at the first moment of the defined time. That is:
for a contest with starttime "12:00:00" and endtime "17:00:00", the
first submission will be accepted at 12:00:00 and the last one at
16:59:59.</P>
<P>The following ordering must always hold: activatetime &lt;= starttime
&lt; (freezetime &lt;=) endtime (&lt;= unfreezetime) (&lt;= deactivatime).</P>


<H2><A NAME="contestsetup:authentication"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc4.3">User authentication </A>
</H2>


<P>The authentication system lets the domserver know which user it is dealing
with and which role(s) the user has. This system is modular, allowing
flexible addition of new methods, if required. The following methods
are available by default for authentication.</P>

<H3>PHP session with passwords (default)</H3>


<P>Each user receives a password and PHP's session management is used to
keep track of which user is logged in. This method is easiest to
setup. It does require the administrator to generate users and passwords
for all teams (this can be done in the jury interface) and distribute those,
though. Also, each team has to login each time they (re)start their
browser. The password is stored in a salted MD5 hash in the
<CODE>password</CODE> field in database (user table).</P>

<H3>IP-address based</H3>


<P>The IP-address of a team's workstation is used as the primary means of
authentication. The system assumes that someone coming from a specific
IP is the user with that IP listed in the user table. When a team
browses to the web interface, this is checked and the appropriate team
page is presented.</P>
<P>This method has the advantage that teams do not have to login. A
requirement for this method is that each team computer has a separate
IP-address from the view of the domserver, though, so this is most
suitable for onsite contests and might not work with online contests
if multiple teams are located behind a router, for example.</P>
<P>There are two possible ways of configuring team IP-addresses.</P>

<H3>Supply it beforehand</H3>


<P>Before the contest starts, when entering teams into the database, add
the IP that each team will have to that user's entry in the
<CODE>ip_address</CODE> field. When the teams
arrive, everything will work directly and without further
configuration (except when teams switch workplaces). If possible, this
is the recommended modus operandi, because it's the least hassle just
before and during the contest.</P>

<H3>Use one-time passwords</H3>


<P>Supply the teams with a one time username and password with which to
authenticate. Beforehand, generate passwords for each team in the jury
interface. When the test session (or contest) starts and a team
connects to the web interface and have an unknown IP, they will be
prompted for username and password. Once supplied, the IP is stored
and the password is removed and not needed anymore the next time.</P>
<P>This is also a secure option, but requires a bit more hassle from the
teams, and maybe from the organisers who have to distribute pieces of
paper.</P>
<P><EM>Note:</EM> the web interface will only allow a team to
authenticate themselves once. If an IP is set, a next authentication
will be refused (to avoid trouble with lingering passwords). In order
to fully re-authenticate a team, the IP address needs to be unset. You
might also want to generate a new password for this specific user.
Furthermore, a team must explicitly connect to the team interface URL,
because with an unknown IP, the root DOMjudge website will redirect to
the public interface.</P>

<H3>Using an external LDAP server</H3>


<P>This method can be useful when you want to integrate DOMjudge into a
larger system, or already have credentials on an LDAP server
available. The <CODE>username</CODE> field in the database must contain
the LDAP username of the DOMjudge user. Furthermore, in
<CODE>etc/domserver-config.php</CODE> the <CODE>LDAP_*</CODE> configuration
settings must be adapted to your setup. Note that multiple (backup)
servers can be specified: they are queried in order to try to
successfully authenticate. After successful authentication against the
LDAP server(s), PHP sessions are used to track login into DOMjudge.</P>

<H3>Fixed authentication</H3>


<P>This method automatically authenticates each connection to the
web interface as a fixed, configurable user. This can be useful for
testing or demonstration purposes, but probably not for real use
scenarios.</P>

<H3>Adding new authentication methods</H3>


<P>The authentication system is modular and adding new authentication
methods is fairly easy. The authentication is handled in the file
<CODE>lib/www/auth.php</CODE>. Adding a new method amounts to editing
the functions in that file to handle your specific case.</P>


<H2><A NAME="contestsetup:testdata"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc4.4">Providing testdata </A>
</H2>

<P>Testdata is used to judge the problems: when a submission run is given the
input testdata, the resulting output is compared to the reference
output data using a <EM>compare script</EM>. The default compare
script simply checks if the outputs are equal up to whitespace
differences, but more elaborate comparisons can be done, see e.g.
the <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>boolfind_cmp</CODE> scripts.</P>
<P>The database has a separate table named testcase, which can be manipulated
from the web interface. Under a problem, click on the testcase link. There
the files can be uploaded. The judgehosts cache a copy based on MD5 sum, so if
you need to make changes later, re-upload the data in the web interface and
it will automatically be picked up.</P>
<P>Testdata can also be imported into the system from a problem zip file,
following the 
<A HREF="http://www.problemarchive.org/wiki/index.php/Problem_Format">Kattis problem package format</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc4.5">Start the daemons</A>
</H2>


<P>Once everything is configured, you can start the daemons.
They all run as a normal user on the system. The needed root privileges
are gained through sudo only when necessary.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> One or more judgedaemons: one on each judgehost (or optionally
multiple per host; then the <CODE>-n X</CODE> option should be used to
bind a judgedaemon to CPU X to prevent CPU resource conflicts).</LI>
<LI> Optionally the balloon notification daemon (as an alternative
to the web interface).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc4.6">Check that everything works</A>
</H2>


<P>If the daemons have started without any problems, you've come a long
way! Now to check that you're ready for a contest.</P>
<P>First, go to the jury interface:
<CODE>http(s)://yourhost.example.edu/domjudge/jury</CODE>. Look under all
the menu items to see whether the displayed data looks sane. Use the
config-checker under `Admin Functions' for some sanity checks on your
configuration.</P>
<P>Go to a team workstation and see if you can access the team page and
if you can submit solutions.</P>
<P>Next, it is time to submit some test solutions. If you have the default
Hello World problem enabled, you can submit some of the example sources
from under the <CODE>doc/examples</CODE> directory. They should give `CORRECT'.</P>
<P>You can also try some (or all) of the sources under
<CODE>tests</CODE>. Use <CODE>make check</CODE> to submit a variety of
tests; this should work when the submit client is available and the
default example problems are in the active contest. There's also
<CODE>make stress-test</CODE>, but be warned that these tests might crash
a judgedaemon. The results can be checked in the web interface; each
source file specifies the expected outcome with some explanations. For
convenience, there is a link <I>judging verifier</I> in the admin
web interface; this will automatically check whether submitted sources
from the <CODE>tests</CODE> directory were judged as expected. Note that a
few sources have multiple possible outcomes: these must be verified
manually.</P>
<P>When all this worked, you're quite ready for a contest. Or at least,
the practice session of a contest.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7</A> <A HREF="admin-manual.html#toc4.7">Testing jury solutions</A>
</H2>


<P>Before running a real contest, you and/or the jury will want to test
the jury's reference solutions on the system.</P>
<P>The simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a
problem zip file and upload this. You can also upload a zip file
containing just solutions to an existing problem. Note that the zip
archive has to adhere to the 
<A HREF="http://www.problemarchive.org/wiki/index.php/Problem_Format">Kattis problem package format</A>.
For this to work, the jury/admin who uploads the problem has to have
an associated team to which the solutions will be assigned. The
solutions will automatically be judged if the contest is active (but
it need not have started yet). You can verify whether the submissions
gave the expected answer from the link on the jury/admin index page.</P>
